# Platform

<span class=hltext>The platform at <a href=https://platform.ad.ecsc2025.pl>platform.ad.ecsc2025.pl</a> is used for distributing WireGuard configs,
collecting player SSH keys, and giving teams control over their cloud-hosted
vulnbox instance.</span>

All players are registered ahead of time on the platform, WireGuard configs
may be downloaded [1 hour before the CTF begins](/#timetable).

With their accounts, players may submit SSH keys, which will later be
deployed onto the vulnbox, as well as download WireGuard configs
for accessing the [game network](/network) through their team-specific router.
